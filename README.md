I have decided to take part in the #100daysofcode challenge.

It seems like an awesome community to be part of.

So let us take a look at what it involves - 

- I will code for at least an hour every day.

- I will be posting every day under the tag #100daysofcode here and on my twitter.

- Its ok to miss a day (add additional days in the end), try not to miss two in a row.

- Most of my code will be related to python,Machine learning, and Deep learning.

- I will be uploading my code on github and keep a log of it. 

- If the project is intersting/useful I will write a blog post on my website.


Also, I would encourage other people to take a look at this challenge too and participate in it.
