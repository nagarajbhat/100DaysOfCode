I have decided to take part in the #100daysofcode challenge.

This is to record my journey and to learn and create awesome stuff.

So let us take a look at what it involves - 

- I will code for at least an hour every day.

- I will be posting every day under the tag #100daysofcode here and on my twitter.

- It is ok to miss a day (add additional days in the end), try not to miss two in a row.

- Most of my code will be related to python, Machine learning, and Deep Learning.

- **I will be uploading my code on Github and keep a log of it in this repository**. 

- If the project is interesting/useful I will write a blog post on my website.


Also, I would encourage other people to take a look at this challenge too and participate in it.
